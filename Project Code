          <b id="center">What is Renvewable Energy:</b> 
           Renewable energy is energy derived from natural resources that replenish themselves over short periods of time. These resources
           include sunlight, wind, water, and geothermal heat. Unlike non-renewable energy sources like coal and natural gas, 
           renewable energy does not run out and is constantly replenished. Renewable energy is also cleaner and more sustainable, 
           producing fewer greenhouse gas emissions and less pollution. This makes it a key solution in combating climate change and 
           promoting environmental sustainability. Additionally, the renewable energy sector has the potential to stimulate economic 
           growth and create jobs. Despite these benefits, the transition to renewable energy requires overcoming a range of technological,
           political, and economic challenges. Renewable energy is energy derived from natural sources that are replenished at a higher rate
           than they are consumed. Sunlight and wind, for example, are such sources that are constantly being replenished. 
           Renewable energy sources are plentiful and all around us

          <li style="font-size: larger;">There are five <strong>major</strong> renewable energy sources:</li>
          <ol>
            <b><li style="font-size: large;">Solar energy from the sun</li></b>
            <p>Solar energy: Explore Solar energy is any type of energy generated by the sun. It is created by a process known as nuclear 
              fusion that takes place in the sun In the sun core, protons of hydrogen atoms violently collide and fuse to create a helium 
              atom. This process, known as a PP (proton-proton) chain reaction, emits an enormous amount of energy In its core, the sun 
              fuses about 620 million metric tons of hydrogen every second. The energy, heat, and light from the sun flow away in the 
              form of electromagnetic radiation (EMR). The electromagnetic spectrum exists as waves of different frequencies and 
              wavelengths. The most high-frequency waves emitted by the sun are gamma rays, X-rays, and ultraviolet radiation (UV rays)
              The sun also emits infrared radiation, whose waves are much lower-frequency. Most heat from the sun arrives as 
              infrared energy Solar energy is harnessed using a range of technologies such as solar power to generate electricity, solar
              thermal energy (including solar water heating), and solar architecture. It is an essential source of renewable energy
              Solar energy warms Earth, causes wind and weather, and sustains plant and animal life. The energy that reaches Earth 
              takes part in a process of warming the planet and making life possible—the so-called “greenhouse effect”. About 30 percent
              of the solar energy that reaches Earth is reflected back into space. The rest is absorbed into Earths atmosphere.

            <b><li style="font-size: large;">Geothermal energy from heat inside the earth</li></b>
            <p>Geothermal energy is thermal energy in the Earths crust. It combines energy from the formation of the planet and from radioactive decay. This energy has been exploited as a source of heat and/or electric power for millennia
              Geothermal energy is generated and stored inside the Earths crust. The Earths center remains at the same temperature as the Sun, which is nearly constant due to the continuous process of nuclear fusion. Due to such high temperature and pressure, some rocks melt, resulting in the mantles upward motion (as they become lighter with the heat). These molten rocks formed in the Earth crust are pushed upward where they get trapped in certain regions called hot spots When underground water comes in contact with the hot spot, steam is generated          
              Unlike wind and solar energy, geothermal plants produce power at a constant rate, without regard to weather conditions. Geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanitys energy needs. Most extraction occurs in areas near tectonic plate boundaries. The cost of generating geothermal power decreased by 25% during the 1980s and 1990s. Technological advances continue to reduce costs and thereby expand the amount of viable resources. In 2021, the U.S. Department of Energy estimated that power from a plant “built today” costs about $0.05/kWh1. In 2019, 13,900 megawatts (MW) of geothermal power was available worldwide. An additional 28 gigawatts provided heat for district heating, space heating, spas, industrial processes, desalination, and agricultural applications as of 20101

            <b><li style="font-size: large;">Wind energy</li></b>
            <p>Wind energy is electricity created from the naturally flowing air in the Earth's atmosphere. As a renewable resource that
               won't get depleted through use, its impact on the environment and climate crisis is significantly smaller than burning 
               fossil fuels. Wind energy can be created by something as simple as a set of 8-foot sails positioned to capture prevailing 
               winds that then turn a stone and grind grain (a gristmill). Or it can be as complex as a 150-foot vane turning a generator 
               that produces electricity to be stored in a battery or deployed over a power distribution system. There are even bladeless
               wind turbines. As of 2021, there are over 67,000 wind turbines running in the United States, found in 44 states, Guam, and 
               Puerto Rico  Wind generated about 8.4% of the electricity in the U.S. in 20201. Worldwide, it provides about 6% of the world's
               electricity needs. Wind energy is growing year-over-year by about 10% and is a key part of most climate change reduction and 
               sustainable growth plans in a variety of countries, including China, India, Germany, and the United States.
               The basic components of any wind energy system are fairly similar. There are blades of some size and shape that are connected 
               to a drive shaft, and then a pump or generator that either uses or collects the wind energy. If the wind energy is used 
               directly as a mechanical force, like milling grain or pumping water, it's a called a windmill; if it converts wind energy 
               to electricity, it's known as a wind turbine. A turbine system requires additional components, such as a battery for 
               electricity storage, or it may be connected to a power distribution system like power lines. Wind energy is the most 
               established and mature renewable energy source. It creates electricity by using the kinetic energy created by the 
               influence of air currents. It is a clean and renewable energy source that decreases greenhouse gas emissions and protects
              the environment.

            <b><li style="font-size: large;">Biomass from plants</li></b>
            <p>Biomass from plants is a type of renewable energy source. It is organic material that comes from plants and animals. 
               Biomass contains stored chemical energy from the sun that is produced by plants through photosynthesis1. This energy can 
               be  released by burning the biomass directly for heat or it can be converted to liquid and gaseous fuels through various 
               processes1. Biomass sources for energy include: Wood and wood processing waste —firewood, wood pellets, and wood chips, 
               lumber and furniture mill sawdust and waste, and black liquor from pulp and paper mills Agricultural crops and waste 
               materials—corn, soybeans, sugar cane, switchgrass, woody plants, algae, and crop and food processing residues, mostly 
               to produce biofuel Biogenic materials in municipal solid waste—paper products; cotton and wool products; and food, yard, 
               and wood wastes is converted to energy through various processes, including:
              <ul>
                <li style="font-size: medium;">Direct combustion (burning) to produce heat</li>
                <li style="font-size: medium;">Thermochemical conversion to produce solid, gaseous, and liquid fuels</li>
                <li style="font-size: medium;">Chemical conversion to produce liquid fuels</li>
                <li style="font-size: medium;">Biological conversion to produce liquid and gaseous fuels</li>
                <li style="font-size: medium;">In 2022, biomass accounted for nearly 5% of U.S. total primary energy consumption. It is an important fuel in many countries, especially for cooking and heating in developing countries.</li>

            <b><li style="font-size: large;">Hydropower from flowing  water</li></b>
            <p>
              Hydropower, or hydroelectric power, is a renewable source of energy that generates 
              power by using a dam or diversion structure to alter the natural flow of a river 
              or other body of water. It relies on the endless, constantly recharging system 
              of the water cycle to produce electricity, using a fuel—water—that is not reduced or eliminated in the process.
              There are many types of hydropower facilities, though they are all powered by the kinetic energy of flowing 
              water as it moves downstream. Hydropower utilizes turbines and generators to convert that kinetic energy into 
              electricity, which is then fed into the electrical grid to power homes, businesses, and industries.
              At the plant level, water flows through a pipe—also known as a penstock—and then spins the blades in a 
              turbine, which, in turn, spins a generator that ultimately produces electricity. The energy available from the moving 
              water depends on both the volume of the water flow and the change in elevation—also known as the head—from one point to 
              another. The greater the flow and the higher the head, the more the electricity that can be generated.
              Most conventional hydroelectric facilities operate this way, including run-of-the-river systems and pumped storage systems. 
              Large, fast-flowing rivers produce the most hydroelectricity. The Columbia River, which forms part of the border between 
              the U.S. states of Washington and Oregon, is a big river that produces massive amounts of hydroelectric energy.

          <section style="font-size: 25px;"><center><strong>Renewable energy its benefits and its potential for generating clean energy</strong></center></section><br>
            <ol><strong style="font-size: large;">Benefits:</strong>
              <li>
                Environmentally Friendly: One of the most significant benefits of renewable energy is its minimal environmental impact. 
                Renewable sources produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions or air pollutants, reducing the adverse effects on climate 
                and air quality.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sustainability: Renewables are inexhaustible resources, making them a sustainable solution for the long term. 
                Unlike fossil fuels, they won't deplete over time.
              </li>
              <li>
                Reduced Carbon Footprint: Using renewables decreases the carbon footprint, contributing to the fight against climate change.
